# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
A: Version control is a system that recods changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is useful because if there are changes in the new code/features and it is bugged , the developers are able to recover specific version of the source code so the program is functioning again until the new codes are ready.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A: A branch is basically an independent line of development. You will use branch if there are several people working on the same project and each working on a different set of features/codes/directions and ultimately programmers are able to merge all the created branches into the master branch. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A: A commit in git is basically records changes to the repository. A good commit message describe what changes has been done in simplified form so both the developer and other developers are able to read and follow up with the commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
A: Merge conflict is when git is trying to merge two different branches together but unable to do so. This occurs because git knows there are changes in either the working directory or staging are that could be written over by the files that you are merging in.
