# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# 'require_relative' links to your own Ruby file(s) in the same directory to refer to specific classes and methods within that file.
# 'require' is more specific in providing the absolute pathway to a Ruby file that may not be yours or you'll pulling from another server.

#the difference between => and :(symbol) are symbol is used when the piece of information is not changable. (e.g population: will not be change throughout the document.)
