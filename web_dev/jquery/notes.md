#Release 0: Make a  plan
## Make a plan on how I am intend to tackle Jquery.
	-Look up  a cheat sheet 
	-watch Jquery tutorial videos
	-go to codepen and make a small project
	-I usually practice the 25-5 tactic, 25 mins of learning and 5 mins of break.

#Release 1 : Study up
	- I think watching the video and code along definitely made the study much more understandable instead of just reading the dc.
	- Reading the cheatsheet only helps me understand so much about the material.
